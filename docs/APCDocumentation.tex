\section{Introduction}

In 1983, or some time before that, {\color{webblue}\href{http://www.forrestmims.org}{Forrest Mims III}}, a long-time participant in the electronics, hobbyist, and atmospheric science communities, designed the ``Stepped Tone Generator" using the wildly popular and hugely versatile {\color{webblue}\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/555_timer_IC}{555 timer integrated circuit}}. He published the design in a Radio Shack (Tandy Corp) book of projects\footnote{Mims, Forrest M., III. 1984. \emph{Engineers's Mini-notebook: 555 Timer IC Projects.} Fort Worth, Texas: Radio Shack.}, and then again in the 1992 \emph{Engineer's Mini-Notebook}\footnote{Mims, Forrest M., III. 1992. \emph{Engineer's Mini-Notebook}. 3\textsuperscript{rd} edition. Fort Worth, Texas: Radio Shack.}.

I was unable to find an example of this board that presented a simple design, an easy soldering task, but also an easy path to customization. People who are getting in to electronics, soldering, and/or ``making" may want a few easy ``wins" for their first few projects, and the ``{\color{webblue}\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_Punk_Console}{Atari Punk Console}}", as it has become known, is a simple circuit with a modest amount of expandability. 

I have re-implemented the design with the intent to provide a series of stepping stones from novice to an intermediate ``maker." Maker spaces like UNT's Factory provide a range of tools to end users, but like many tools, learning to use them can be a challenge. Here again, this design of the APC is up to the task. With easy alignment notches and a downloadable reference design for a 3D-printed case, users can learn to solder, solder the APC, and print a case for it, without facing serious hurdles. 

This project and its ancillary pieces allow novices to gain experience in several aspects of hobbyist making, while not facing the full force of electrical or industrial engineering. Put another way: one should not be required to learn typesetting in order to print a Microsoft Word document; neither should one be required to understand G-Code or STL files in order to produce a working and fun electronics project.

This guide provides graphical and instructional information about the assembly of this version of the ``Stepped Tone Generator". Please read this guide all the way through before beginning any work on the boards.

\section{Best Practices}
\bi
\+ Use a wrist-strap ground during soldering; these components can be easily damaged by static electricity
\+ Use thin (perhaps 0.032-inch or 0.8mm) solder for through-hole components
\+ Use a good quality soldering iron
\+ Clean the tip often on the brass scrubber
\+ Re-tin the tip often
\+ Lifting PCB pads and traces is quite possible without much effort---watch the iron temperature, and don't apply heat for more than ten seconds per soldered pin 
\+ Don't buy or use low-quality solder, leaded or not; it gets gummy and is more or less impossible to remove without thermal damage to your components. Use name-brand solder, like {\color{webblue}\href{http://www.kester.com}{Kester}}
\+ Masking tape may be helpful to hold pin headers in place while soldering the underside
\+ Tweezers or small pliers are useful (but not necessary) for placement of the SMD component
\ei


\section{Useful Equipment For Testing}
\bi
\+ A 9V battery
\+ A 6V to 13.8V DC power source, capable of providing at least 300 milliamps of current
\+ A multimeter
\+ A stereo magnifier, an inspection loupe, and/or a USB microscope
\+ A third hand or PCB vise
\+ A set of headphones or a powered speaker
\ei


\section{Assembly Order}

\begin{itemize}
\+ Discrete resistors
\+ Diodes (note the orientation!)
\+ Disc capacitors
\+ Electrolytic (aluminum, polarized) capacitor(s)
\+ 2- and 3-pin headers
\+ LED (note the orientation!)
\+ 8-pin integrated circuit sockets (note the orientation!)
\+ DC power jack
\+ 9V battery cradle
\+ SMD headphone jack (see text)
\+ Variable resistors (potentiometers / rheostats)
\+ Switch
\end{itemize}

After the sockets are installed, consider the orientation of the 555 timers and press them completely into the sockets. It may be helpful to line up four pins on one side with the socket connector, insert them about 1mm, then gently press the opposite side pins inward until they can also be fit into the socket. 

When soldering the stereo jack, heat a large pad on the PCB and melt a little solder onto it. Align the jack and hold it in place (the tab will be on top of the now-tinned PCB pad) with pliers, tweezers, or whatever you have. Hold the soldering iron tip on top of the tab, or touching both the pad and the tab, and the heat will eventually melt the solder and bond the tab to the board. If you have correctly aligned the jack, the other tabs and pads will be easy to solder. If not, re-melt the solder until you can get the jack to align properly. It may be helpful to press down with the tweezers or pliers (even clamping the board and the jack together with them). You don't want the tab to ``float'' up on the solder blob. 

\section{Hardware Testing}

\bi
\+ Turn the switch to `off'
\+ Install a 9V battery in the battery carrier
\+ Using a multimeter, check the voltage at the output (left, on this board) terminal of diodes D1 and D2
\+ Turn the switch to `on' and check the power LED indicator
\+ If the LED does not illuminate, use a multimeter to confirm that there is at least 6 volts available at the LED positive terminal

\+ Set all the knobs to the middle
\+ plug in the headphones and check for sound

It is also possible to create standoffs \emph{within} the case that provide underside clearance for fasteners such that the fasteners do not have exposed surfaces outside the case, at the slight expense of a taller overall case.}

\section{Device Schematic}

Although not required to successfully assemble and use the Stepped Tone Generator, some may find the schematic useful or interesting. There are also many schematics of similar implementations of Forrest Mims's work online. This implementation stays very close to the original, with a few small additions like the touchpad headers and the optional capacitors, that can be ignored if desired. I varied a few of the other components based on experience. To create this image, from the schematic pane, type (no quotes!)

\section{How To Make The Images In This Document}

This document includes images created from within Eagle CAD and using external programs. To show how it is done, and to provide any hints to those who would like to see how the documentation was made, I include the following mini-tutorial.

\subsection*{EagleCAD Schematic and Layout Images }

An EagleCAD script is provided in Figure \ref{fig:codelistexport} and in the GitHub repository. Run the script from within EagleCAD and the first set of images will appear. Basically, the script turns on the layers for each particular image, sets color or monochrome, sets the resolution to 600 DPI, and exports each resulting layer set to a PNG file. For instance, before making the \emph{top} layer, the script turns off the set of layers in EagleCAD that would make it hard to parse the top components -- i.e.~all of the ``bottom'' layers, like 16, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30, 32, 34, 36, 40, 42, 52, 122, 126, 128, and, as noted above, 200 (where the logo image silkscreen resides). To make an image of the underside, a similar operation is performed, blanking the ``top" layers. The script writes image files called:

\bigskip

\begin{tabular}{lll}
\tabitem \texttt{fullcolorboard.png} && \tabitem \texttt{boardlayout.png} \\[\sep]
\tabitem \texttt{boardtoplayout.png} && \tabitem \texttt{boardbottomlayout.png} \\[\sep]
\tabitem \texttt{boardbottomsilk.png} && \tabitem \texttt{boardtopsilk.png} \\[\sep]
\tabitem \texttt{boarddimensions.png} \\[\sep]
\end{tabular}

 frame=single]
 {./exportspecificlayers.scr}

\caption{The \texttt{EagleCAD} script to export images from EagleCAD.}
\label{fig:codelistexport}
\end{figure}


The script to appropriately convert the images is seen in Figure \ref{fig:codelistconvert}. The resulting files are called: 

\medskip

\begin{tabular}{lll}
\tabitem \texttt{\colorimagename} && \tabitem \texttt{\twolayermonochrome} \\[\sep]
\tabitem \texttt{\topmonochrome} && \tabitem \texttt{\bottommonochrome} \\[\sep]
\tabitem \texttt{\topsilk} && \tabitem \texttt{\bottomsilk} \\[\sep]
\tabitem \texttt{\boarddimensions} \\[\sep]
\end{tabular}
\medskip

\noindent This script was written for macOS but should run on any system with 
{\color{webblue}\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_%28Unix_shell%29}{\texttt{bash}}}
and {\color{webblue}\href{http://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php}{ImageMagick}} installed.

\subsection*{8-bit Art in Eagle CAD}

The PCB also includes three pieces of art from the ancient era of video games. The Asteroids ship was converted using the \texttt{import-bmp.ulp} user language script that is included in Eagle CAD. The other two presented a fun challenge, which was to draw the 8-bit sprites using the Eagle CAD scripting language. It's pretty easy to draw squares and rectangles using the language, so I wrote a Python script that reads in a very simple csv file, composed of rows of comma-separated ``1'' or ``0'' cells. The Python script then writes out a nice (and easily scalable, if you check out the top of the script) Eagle CAD script that draws the figure in the layer you specify. It's much faster than drawing it yourself, and the CAM script runs much faster too, since the sprites are so simple.
