# Atari Punk Console Implementation
##### *with modifications*

## What's In Here

- EAGLE CAD schematics 
- Detailed LaTeX documentation
- A few interesting EAGLE CAD scripts
    - at least one of which requires a script in another of my GitHub repositories
- a bill of materials for this implementation
- a python script that makes drawing 8-bit characters in EAGLE CAD pretty easy

## Where Things Are

- cad: EAGLE CAD files and the script to export images from the program
- docs: LaTeX documentation, images, and the bash script that uses ImageMagick to modify and improve the native png image exports
- graphics: EAGLE CAD scripts that draw old 8-bit characters as part of the silkscreen layers of the PCB; includes the source csv and the python script used to make the scripts
